#### Business Website Development Assignment

The 'business' chose: Teddy Bear store. I've employed a common design theme and colour scheme throughout. <br>

I create a business e-commerce website that employs the principles of
HTML5, CSS and JavaScript which meets the requirements specified below. <br>

##### Requirements
The website:<br>
• Allows the user to ‘purchase’ items from the site;<br>
• Allows the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated (via a login screen)
before receiving a summary of the order;<br>
• Performs form validation through JavaScript to ensure that:<br>
o text fields are not empty;<br>
o a valid email address is entered.<br>
• Connects to a database that contains relevant site information (eg., product
info);<br>

It is responsive website, that displays on standard devices from large screen monitors, to
tablets and phones.I've used the Bootstrap framework (via CDN).

*For this project, 'purchase' means that the user is presented with the possibility to choose
a product or item, select a quantity, and if the purchased button is clicked, they will be presented
with a total cost.<br>
