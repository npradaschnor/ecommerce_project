Business Website Development Assignment - Web Application Module

The 'business' can be of your choosing (or can be a personal site meeting the requirements
outlined below). You should employ a common design theme and colour scheme throughout. 

Requirements
Your website should:
• Allow the user to ‘purchase’* items from the site;
• Allow the customer to enter their login details and have login details validated (via a login screen)
before receiving a summary of the order;
• Perform form validation through JavaScript to ensure that:
o text fields are not empty;
o a valid email address is entered.
• Include a slideshow or carousel which displays a different image each time the page is loaded;
• Access and change HTML on the web page through the DOM;
• Access and change styling through the DOM;
• Demonstrate the use of events;
• Connect to a database that contains relevant site information (eg., product
info);
• Use the Bootstrap framework (via CDN)
• Be a responsive website, that should display on standard devices from large screen monitors, to
tablets and phones.
*For this assignment, 'purchase' can mean that the user is presented with the possibility to choose
a product or item, select a quantity, and if the purchased button is clicked, they will be presented
with a total cost.
